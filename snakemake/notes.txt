# This assumes running on the PGV compute node, which already has a GATK jar.
# Instructions still apply on a different machine, but will require installing GATK.

# Set up a Conda environment:

# snakemake needs python3
conda create -n pgv
source activate pgv

# set up Bioconda; install channels in this order
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda

# install a bunch of bio tools; gatk needs to be this version, latest doesn't work
# graphviz needed for DAG visualization
# ucsc-liftover for converting coverage bed files between various alignments
# java version specific to MuTect
conda install bwa samtools sambamba snakemake picard gatk==3.7 graphviz bedtools ucsc-liftover java-jdk==8.0.92

# need to link GATK
# unfortunately, then also need to edit the gatk binary (see "which gatk") to have the right
# value for jar_file.
gatk-register /data/biokepi-work-dir/workdir/toolkit/gatk.NOVERSION/GenomeAnalysisTK_37.jar

# MuTect 1.1.7 downloaded from https://software.broadinstitute.org/gatk/download/mutect, to path:
# /biokepi/workdir/toolkit/mutect-1.1.7.jar 

# MuTect needs Java 1.7, while GATK and other things need Java 1.8.
# Dealing with this by setting up a separate Conda environment, specifically for Java 7
conda create -n java17
source activate java17
conda install java-jdk==7.0.91
# This results in java 7 being installed to /home/julia/miniconda3/envs/java17/bin/java
# This should be run only for MuTect.
