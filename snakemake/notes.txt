# This assumes running on the PGV compute node, which already has a GATK jar.
# Instructions still apply on a different machine, but will require installing GATK.

# Set up a Conda environment:

# snakemake needs python3
conda create -n pgv
source activate pgv

# set up Bioconda; install channels in this order
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels defaults
conda config --add channels conda-forge
conda config --add channels bioconda

# install a bunch of bio tools; gatk needs to be this version, latest doesn't work
# graphviz needed for DAG visualization
# ucsc-liftover for converting coverage bed files between various alignments
conda install bwa samtools sambamba snakemake picard gatk==3.7 graphviz bedtools ucsc-liftover

# need to link GATK
# unfortunately, then also need to edit the gatk binary (see "which gatk") to have the right
# value for jar_file.
gatk-register /data/biokepi-work-dir/workdir/toolkit/gatk.NOVERSION/GenomeAnalysisTK_37.jar
